📘 Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Sequence Models — Final Report
1. Introduction

The task was to perform binary sentiment classification (Positive vs Negative) on an Urdu dataset using multiple sequence-based deep learning models.
The following models were implemented:

RNN

GRU

LSTM

BiLSTM

Multilingual BERT (mBERT)

XLM-RoBERTa

All models were trained on 75% training and 25% testing data.

5. Analysis of Results
1️⃣ RNN – Worst Performance

Simple RNN struggles with long-term dependencies.

Low accuracy (44%) but high recall (70%) → predicts “Positive” too often.

Shows vanishing gradient limitations.

2️⃣ GRU – Improved Over RNN

GRU handles sequential memory better.

High recall (83%) but still moderate accuracy.

Good for limited data and smaller GPU setups.

3️⃣ LSTM – Better Than GRU

Best performance among classical sequence models.

High recall and balanced precision → F1 = 0.64.

Captures temporal dependencies more effectively.

4️⃣ BiLSTM – Mixed Outcome

Surprisingly lower F1 than LSTM.

High precision but low recall → predicts “Negative” too often.

Bi-directional context didn't generalize well on short tweets.

5️⃣ mBERT – Transformer Power but Not Best

Understands multilingual text well.

Still limited because Urdu vocabulary is smaller than Hindi/Arabic.

Good recall (74%) but moderate accuracy.

**6️⃣ XLM-RoBERTa – BEST MODEL

Highest accuracy (71%)

Best precision and balanced recall.

Uses a larger multilingual corpus and better subword tokenization than mBERT.

Generalizes the best for Urdu sentiment classification.
